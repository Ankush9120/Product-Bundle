# overview

I have created this chocolate bundle using plain HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Here, you can select your favourite chocolates and add it to your bundle. You can only add 8 chocolates.

# logic

I am using eventListeners to handle the click events on the chocolates . When ever you will click on the chocolate a function will be called which will retrieve name and price of the chocolate in the form of object then with the given condition if array have less than 8 objects it will push the data one by one . Then addNewChocolate and calculateTotalPrice will be called to update chocolate in the bundle and calculate the total price of it in our webpage.
